# About this plugin

This plugin relies on [token based authentication][token-auth-wiki]. This requires coordination between the client and the server. [Diagrams](#conceptual) are included to illustrate this relationship.

This plugin was designed to work out of the box with the wonderful [devise token auth][dta] gem, but it's flexible enough to be used in just about any environment.

**About security**: [read here][so-post] for more information on securing your token auth system. The [devise token auth][dta] gem has adequate security measures in place, and this plugin was built to work seamlessly with that gem.

# Installation

Only npm is currently supported.

~~~sh
npm install redux-auth --save
~~~

# Configuration

This is the most difficult step, but only because configuring a [redux][redux] app is inherently difficult.

The following example assumes that you are familiar with redux, and that you know how to [create a store][redux-create-store].

~~~js
// include dependencies
import React from "react";
import {Provider} from "react-redux";
import {configure, authStateReducer, AuthGlobals} from "../../src";
import {createStore, compose, applyMiddleware, combineReducers} from "redux";
import {AuthGlobals} from "redux-auth"

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <AuthGlobals />
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
